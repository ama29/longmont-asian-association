        The Asian-Pacific Association of Longmont (A-PAL) is a 501(c)(3)
        organization, founded in 2010. A-PAL’s mission is to promote diversity and
        bridge cultural gaps through the development and hosting of cultural,
        educational, and artistic projects and events, as well as by encouraging
        active participation in city and school district initiatives and
        activities. A-PAL also urges greater utilization of programs and services
        offered by public institutions. Additionally, A-PAL provides referral
        assistance to those who have the need or are unfamiliar with available

        We differ from similar organizations within Colorado in that we work in collaboration with a variety of groups, from individuals to governmental agencies. Our partners include the City of Longmont, St. Vrain Valley Schools, Silver Creek High School’s Leadership Academy, Front Range Community College, the Boulder Asian Pacific Alliance, numerous private businesses, local nonprofits, and individual community members. One of our most significant partnerships involves the Silver Creek Leadership Academy at Silver Creek High School, where we mentor students in developing leadership skills and embracing Chinese culture. Our commitment to promoting multiculturalism within the community engages people from a variety of ages and backgrounds in Longmont and beyond.
