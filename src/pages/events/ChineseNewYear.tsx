        Lunar New Year is one of the most important celebrations for Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, Singaporean, and other East and Southeastern Asian cultures.
        The holiday marks the beginning of a new year on the traditional lunar calendar. China’s Lunar New Year is known as the Spring Festival or Chūnjié (春节/春節) in Mandarin, while for example, Koreans call it Seollal (설날), and Vietnamese refer to it as Tết.

        Every year, we host a free open-to-public event at Silver Creek High School to celebrate the Lunar New Year.
        Although many performance and activities change on a year to year basis, we have a few favorites that make an annual appearance!
        The next Chinese New Year will be on February 10, 2024.
